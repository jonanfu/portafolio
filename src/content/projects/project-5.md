MentorIA+ is an artificial intelligence solution designed to enhance the work of career coaches by providing an interactive and inclusive support system to facilitate the training and professional development of people with disabilities or barriers to employment. Through an intuitive and accessible conversational interface, MentorIA+ allows coaches to create personalized learning paths, automate routine consultations, and offer motivational assistance.

For employees, MentorIA+ provides an accessible learning experience with voice interaction, high contrast, and adaptability to different needs. Additionally, the system allows for progress assessment through questionnaires and the generation of detailed reports to optimize the learning curve. This not only improves the efficiency of on-the-job training but also ensures ongoing support that reinforces inclusion and equity in employment.
