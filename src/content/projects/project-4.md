I developed a credit risk model using Azure Machine Learning, employing MLflow to track experiments and manage model versions. The model utilized logistic regression to predict the likelihood of credit default based on historical customer and transaction data. I used Scikit-learn for model training, evaluation, and fine-tuning, ensuring the model's performance met the desired accuracy and business requirements. The solution was deployed in a production environment for real-time risk assessments.
